### What is Rest Assured Framework

Rest Assured enables you to test REST APIs using java libraries and integrates well with Maven. It has very efficient matching techniques, so asserting your expected results is also pretty straight forward. Rest Assured has methods to fetch data from almost every part of the request and response no matter how complex the JSON structures are.

## Why Do We Need REST Assured?

Information related to the REST Assured Java library leads us to believe in its dependability. The primary reasons why we need REST Assured are as follows: 

It is an attractive option for API automation because it is an open-source library with a thriving development community.
It was challenging to test APIs using dynamic languages like Ruby and Groovy.
REST service testing and validation are more complex in Java. 
It gets more straightforward and more effortless with REST Assured. 
Sending encrypted HTTPS requests with a few lines of Java code is a breeze using this module.
Automating the backend using rest assured provides reasonable confidence once the fundamentals of API and integration testing have been mastered. As a result, we will have extra time for front-end testing.
